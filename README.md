* Make a Scrabble word finder app with both a server and client. On the client,
  the UI simply is a text input for your up-to-7 letters in your Scrabble rack,
  and a button to send the letters to the server.
* On the server side, efficiently find words which can be made with those
  letters, within a big dictionary. Display the list of found words on the
  client side.
* like before, avoid googling. if you have to google, please note the fact. like
  before, don't use frameworks on the client side, just plain vanilla JS and DOM
  APIs.

## Google Log

* Had to explore raw node to understand streams at a deeper level. This ate away
  at most of the crucial time I needed to finish this in a timely manner.

## Retrospective

Had to explore raw node to understand streams at a deeper level. This ate away
at most of the crucial time I needed to finish this in a timely manner. Will
continue to explore node streams and how I can then integrate txt files into a
node server. That being said, I'm excited to learn how to integrate different
files other than js, html, and css together. Especially coming back from the
hackathon having created routes that successfully integrates python scripts.
More to come.
